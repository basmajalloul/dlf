# Differential Learning Framework

Official implementation of the Differential Learning Index (DLI) framework with full experimental notebooks, processed datasets, and supplementary materials for cognitive and motor learning assessment.

## ðŸ“– Overview
- DLI Computation using Autoencoders, Transformers, and DTW.
- LLM-based interpretability for generating human-readable learning assessments.
- Ablation studies demonstrating the contribution of DLI to explainability.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `data/`: Processed datasets and result files.
- `Notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
- `Supplementary/`: Additional materials including mathematical formulations and LLM prompt templates.
- `LICENSE`: Licensing information.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Explore the notebooks in the `Notebooks/` directory for step-by-step experiments.
